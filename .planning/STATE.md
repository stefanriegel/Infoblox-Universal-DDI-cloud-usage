## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phase 2 builds the full end-to-end pipeline (discovery -> counting -> tokens -> reports) with AWS as first provider, so Phases 3-4 only add provider-specific discovery
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 addresses 4 of 6 critical pitfalls (auth expiry, exception masking, checkpoint corruption, signal handler state loss) before any cloud SDK code

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Azure ARM tenant-level throttling behavior at 100-500 subscriptions needs pre-implementation research in Phase 3
- [Research]: GCP aggregatedList availability per resource type needs validation before Phase 4
