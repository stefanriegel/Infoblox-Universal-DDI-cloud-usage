### 🚧 v1.6 Wizard Navigation Fix (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Replace brittle JS-based wizard navigation with server-driven HX-Redirect so scan start reliably lands on the progress tab regardless of browser JS event handling quirks.

#### Phase 24: Wizard Navigation Fix

- [x] **Phase 24: Wizard Navigation Fix** - Replace JS-driven scan-start navigation with server-driven HX-Redirect header (completed 2026-03-03)

**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete

Plans:
- [ ] 24-01-PLAN.md — Verify HX-Redirect implementation and commit NAV-01/02/03

## Phase Details

### Phase 24: Wizard Navigation Fix
**Goal**: Wizard scan-start navigation is server-driven and reliable — HTMX follows HX-Redirect without any JS event handlers
**Depends on**: Phase 23
**Requirements**: NAV-01, NAV-02, NAV-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After clicking "Start Scan" in the wizard Step 4 form, the browser navigates to the progress tab with no JS event handler involvement — navigation is driven entirely by HTMX following the HX-Redirect header
  2. The Step 4 review form HTML contains only `hx-post` — no `hx-target`, `hx-swap`, or `hx-on` attributes are present on the form element
  3. A test verifies that a successful call to the scan-start endpoint returns HTTP 200 with an `HX-Redirect` header pointing to `/tab/progress` and an empty response body
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 24-01-PLAN.md — Verify HX-Redirect implementation and commit NAV-01/02/03
